# Basic Search Algorithms Implementation

## Overview

Implementation of **BFS**, **DFS**, **Dijkstra** and **A*** algorithms. These are the basic algorithms for discrete map path planning. 

Files included:

**search.py** is the file where all the algorithms are implemented.

**main.py** is the script that provides helper functions that load the map from csv files and visualize the map and path.

**map.csv** is the map file you could modify to create your own map and test out the algorithms.

## Instructions to run the code

- Gitclone the repository.
- Edit the **map.csv** file to create your own map. Use 1 for obstacles and 0 for free space.
- Run the main.py script to see the plotted results. 

## Results 
<!-- The plot generated shows the path with the least cost. The terminal also shows number of steps required for the shortest path and the total steps taken to find the optimal solution. -->
